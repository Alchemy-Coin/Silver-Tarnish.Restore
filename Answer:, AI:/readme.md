>Keep it dry: Moisture and liquids are the fastest way to tarnish silver. 
>Store it properly: Store your silver jewelry in a way that prevents tarnishing. 
>Use a jewelry protectant spray: A jewelry protectant spray can help prevent tarnishing. 
>Clean with vinegar, water, and baking soda: Mix 1/2 cup of white vinegar with 2 tablespoons of baking soda in a bowl of lukewarm water. Soak the silver for two to three hours. 
>Polish with a silver polishing cloth: Gently polish the silver with a silver polishing cloth to remove any yellow discoloration. 
>Tarnish is not permanent and can be easily removed with the right cleaning products. However, pure silver never tarnishes because it's too soft to be used to make jewelry or utensils. Instead, pure silver is often mixed with other metals like copper to create a stronger, more durable alloy.
